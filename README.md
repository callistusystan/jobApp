# Job Searching App

This project is a complex fully functional cross playform mobile app for searching jobs.

It features Facebook login, and a map to specify a job search area. Users can make use of the Tinder "swipe" feature to specify jobs that they are interested in.


Made while taking the React Native: Advanced Concepts course instructed by Stephen Grider. https://www.udemy.com/react-native-advanced/
